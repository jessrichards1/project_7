<p>Artrepreneurs Boston is an independently funded non-profit consulting agency dedicated to creating and facilitating partnerships between Boston based for-profit + non-profit sectors in order to add value to the local creative economy. In addition to the collaboration, we provide services such as marketing and public relations expertise for for-profits and non-profits to expand their potential and make them thrive.<br>

<br>We work with Boston based start-up companies to plan a Corporate Social Responsibility platform and work towards eventual B Corporation certification. <br>

<span class="break"><br> Goals:
<br>&#43; Attract, foster and retain entrepreneurial talent and small business in the city of Boston
<br>&#43; Community collaboration and partnerships
<br>&#43; Embed the for-profit sector into the cultural fabric of the Boston community 
<br>&#43; Make the for-profit and non-profit sectors allies along with the private sector
<br>&#43; Expand non-profitsâ€™ capacity to serve its community

<br>We believe in the need and value of balancing profits with purpose. Out of the hundreds of Certified B Corporations globally, only 13 of these companies are located in the city of Boston.  There are immense benefits of having a local economy mainly fueled by B Corps.<br>
